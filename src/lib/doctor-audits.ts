/**
 * src/lib/doctor-audits.ts — the CDMSS per-doctor findings fetcher.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE READ PATH IS READ-ONLY. This module fetches; it writes nothing. The two write paths live in
 * src/lib/findings-actions.ts (private reactions use PORTAL_REACTIONS; workflow responses use the
 * independent PORTAL_FINDINGS_RESPOND flag).
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING HERE SHAPES WHAT A PHYSICIAN SEES. The upstream payload is typed below so the fetcher
 * is honest about what it receives, but the browser-facing shape is built in src/lib/doctor-card.ts
 * by ALLOWLIST: `triage`, `ruling`, `reference`, `doctor_uid`, `overdue`, `sla_due_at` and the
 * envelope's `metrics` are simply never read there. The upstream fields are `unknown` on purpose,
 * so a later edit cannot start rendering one without a type error pointing at this comment.
 *
 * ⚠️ STANDING PORTAL CONTRACT: `physicians.cdmss_doctor_uid` is NEVER exposed by a portal API. The
 * reaction and response endpoints look it up server-side per request and never read it from, nor
 * return it to, the client.
 *
 * CONTRACT FIELDS (all optional, CDMSS adds them in parallel): per finding `routed`, `note_class`,
 * `note_date`, `evidence_excerpt`, `citations`, `patient{name,age,sex,ip_number,uhid}`. They are read
 * from the representative first, then from the signal. Absent means nothing is rendered.
 *
 * Fetch idioms (x-api-key, GOV_API_BASE default, cache:'no-store', the 8s abort) are the ones
 * src/lib/gov-signals.ts already uses. That file is NOT modified and NOT imported.
