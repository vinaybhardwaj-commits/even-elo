/**
 * src/lib/cdmss-mapping-service.ts — doctor-mapping run + staff review (Round 2 / F3).
 *
 * `computeMapping` is the F1 matcher run against the live CDMSS directory and the active physicians;
 * the admin endpoint (/api/admin/map-cdmss-doctors) and the staff review page both call it, so the
 * review list IS the F1 endpoint's `review` list, not a second opinion.
 *
 * Review rules:
 *   · A weak match is a (CDMSS doctor, candidate physician) pair. Staff CONFIRM one pair (writes
 *     physicians.cdmss_doctor_uid) or REJECT one pair (it stops being offered).
 *   · A confirm is only accepted for a pair that is in the CURRENT review list (the list is recomputed
 *     on every decision, so a stale page cannot link a physician the matcher no longer proposes).
 *   · A confirm only ever fills an EMPTY link: a physician already linked to any uid is never
 *     overwritten here (409 physician_already_linked), and a CDMSS uid already held by another
 *     physician is refused by the unique index (409 uid_already_linked).
 *   · Every decision is written to cdmss_mapping_decisions (who, when, why) and to audit_log_v2.
 *     The decision row is written FIRST and removed again if the link write fails, so a link without
 *     its audit row cannot exist.
