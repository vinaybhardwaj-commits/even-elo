/**
 * POST /api/admin/oppe-kickstart
 *
 * Decision #21 in the credentialing PRD. One-shot button (rendered on /admin
 * for super_admin) that creates an OPPE row for EVERY existing Active
 * engagement that doesn't already have an open OPPE. Use this when the team's
 * ready to take on the review work for the first time.
 *
 * The recurring scheduler (POST /api/admin/oppe-scheduler) only creates rows
 * for engagements past their 6mo cycle. The kickstart ignores timing and
 * gives every active engagement a baseline OPPE due in 30 days.
 *
 * URL-gated. Safe to re-run: skips engagements that already have an open
 * OPPE.
