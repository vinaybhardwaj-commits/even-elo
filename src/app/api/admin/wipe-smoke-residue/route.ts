/**
 * POST /api/admin/wipe-smoke-residue
 *
 * Clears all smoke + test data so the system is ready to onboard real
 * physician data. Keeps the 4 super_admin profiles + 4 hospitals + the
 * shared positions catalogue + profile_hospital_roles intact.
 *
 * Extended in CR.5+ to cover the new credentialing tables (oppe_reviews,
 * privilege_requests, vc_prescreen_hospitals, incident_views) and to
 * drop the stale `positions.hospital_id` JOIN that v3.0a removed.
 *
 * Idempotent — safe to re-run; subsequent runs just confirm empty state.
