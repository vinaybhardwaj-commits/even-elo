/**
 * POST /api/admin/oppe-scheduler
 *
 * The recurring 6-month rollover job. Designed to be wired to Vercel cron
 * once V configures it; usable manually as an URL-gated admin endpoint until
 * then.
 *
 * For each active engagement (status='active', physician.current_status≠'terminated'):
 *   - If the engagement has any non-final OPPE (status pending|in_review):
 *     skip — a review is already on someone's plate.
 *   - Else if the most recent COMPLETED OPPE was >6 months ago, OR no OPPE
 *     exists AND start_date is >6 months ago: create a new oppe_reviews row.
 *
 * Creates with: period_start = MAX(prev_completed_period_end, NOW-6mo)
 *               period_end = NOW
 *               due_at = NOW + 30 days
 *               status='pending'
 *               packet_jsonb = snapshot of the 6-month metrics + incidents +
 *                              patient_feedback for this physician × hospital.
 *
 * URL-gated: same pattern as other /api/admin/* bootstrap endpoints. Wire to
 * Vercel cron via vercel.json + CRON_SECRET when ready (PRD §C.6).
