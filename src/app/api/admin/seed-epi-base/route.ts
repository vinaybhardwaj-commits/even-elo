/**
 * POST /api/admin/seed-epi-base
 *
 * One-shot EPI.0a base seed. Idempotent (deletes + re-inserts).
 *
 * What this does:
 *   1. Wipes v1 ELO data (vcs → cascades cases/observations/snapshots) +
 *      weight_versions + audit_log + profiles/engagements/privileges/
 *      physicians/hospitals/positions.
 *   2. Inserts EHRC hospital row.
 *   3. Inserts 14 EPI positions, all scoped to EHRC (lock-down decision #17).
 *   4. Inserts pilot weight_version 33/34/33 so v1 ELO recompute logic still works.
 *   5. Inserts V (Vinay Bhardwaj) as a physician + engagement + profile.
 *      PIN=1981 (bcrypt hash precomputed; EPI.0b's auth route will verify).
 *
 * URL-gated. v1 pattern.
