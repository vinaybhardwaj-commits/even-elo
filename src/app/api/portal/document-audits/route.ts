/**
 * GET /api/portal/document-audits — the signed-in physician's document-audit findings that a doctor
 * may see (visibility is decided per finding in SQL: portal_visible, never the audit's stamp).
 *
 * ⚠️ THE RESPONSE IS AN ALLOWLIST. Each stored row is rebuilt as a doctor card by `toDocumentCards`,
 * the same card shape the live Findings list uses. Authors, external references, severities,
 * statuses and signal references are not read, so they cannot be shipped. A finding that is also on
 * the live list is left out here (answering it there avoids asking the doctor twice).
 * The answer is `{ ok, cards }` and nothing else.
