/**
 * POST /api/portal/document-audits/respond — a physician responds to one of their findings.
 *
 * Body: `{ finding_id, verb, comment? }`. A disagreement or a request for clarification needs a
 * comment (the same rule as the live Findings response). A finding can be answered once. Every
 * failure is a plain sentence in `message`; the code in `error` is for the client's logic only.
 *
 * When the finding is one CDMSS routed (it has a signal reference) the answer is also forwarded to
 * CDMSS after it is saved here (src/lib/response-sync.ts). That is a bounded, best-effort attempt:
 * the doctor's submit never waits on it beyond a few seconds and never fails because of it. A failed
 * delivery is stored and retried by the nightly cron.
