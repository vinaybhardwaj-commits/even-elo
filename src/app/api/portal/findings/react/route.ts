/**
 * POST /api/portal/findings/react — WM2 v1: record this doctor's PRIVATE reaction to one finding.
 *
 * ⚠️ PRIVATE MEANS PRIVATE. This notifies nobody. It does not change the signal's status, does not
 * reach the care manager, and is not the workflow response — that is ../respond. The card says so
 * above the buttons, and this route must never grow a side effect that makes the card's promise
 * false.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLIENT NEVER NAMES A DOCTOR. The body is exactly `{ signal_id, reaction }` and a body with
 * any other key is refused outright, rather than ignored. Ignoring extra keys is how a
 * `doctor_uid` in a request eventually gets read by a later edit; refusing them makes that edit
 * fail a test instead. Both identities are server-side: `physician_id` comes from the session JWT,
 * `cdmss_doctor_uid` from the physicians table.
 *
 * ⚠️ ALWAYS HTTP 200 (except 401). A doctor pressed a button; they are owed a sentence, not a
 * status code. Every CDMSS answer and every transport failure is mapped to one word in the body
 * and the card turns that word into the sentence. The one exception is "not signed in", which is
 * the browser's problem to solve, not the doctor's.
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL: this sandbox has no live database. Both queries below are listed verbatim in the
 * ship report. The lookup mirrors ../route.ts; the audit insert mirrors ../../auth/login/route.ts.
