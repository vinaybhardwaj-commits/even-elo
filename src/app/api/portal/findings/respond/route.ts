/**
 * POST /api/portal/findings/respond — WM2 v1: send the workflow response a finding asked for.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS ONE LEAVES THE BUILDING. Unlike ../react, a response goes to the care manager, moves the
 * signal's status, and cannot be revised from the portal afterwards. The card says that in words
 * before the doctor presses anything, and `already_responded` says it again if they try twice.
 *
 * ⚠️ THE CLIENT NEVER NAMES A DOCTOR. `cdmss_doctor_uid` is looked up from the session's physician
 * id, and only signal_id, verb and comment are accepted from the body. The BFF creates the
 * client_request_id and sends it as both the payload field and Idempotency-Key.
 *
 * ⚠️ NOTHING FROM THE CDMSS BODY IS FORWARDED. CDMSS answers with a governance signal (uid, triage,
 * ruling, importance, possibly a null representative). The answer here is `{ ok, state }` where
 * `state` is `toResponseState(body)`: the new status and the recorded response (verb, comment,
 * time) and nothing else. If CDMSS sent no response, the doctor's own submission stands in for it.
 * The browser MERGES `state` into the card it already holds; it never replaces the card.
 *
 * ⚠️ ALWAYS HTTP 200 (except 401). See ../react for why.
 *
 * ⚠️ INFERRED SQL: this sandbox has no live database. Both queries below are listed verbatim in the
 * ship report. The lookup mirrors ../route.ts; the audit insert mirrors ../../auth/login/route.ts.
